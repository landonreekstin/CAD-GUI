A simple CAD GUI using JavaFX allows the user to draw lines and shapes. Settings are imported from a text file. 
The UI includes buttons, drop down menus, mouse selection, redo/undo feature, and the ability to save and load from a file. 
The focus of this project was to utilize and understand object-oriented design methods, while creating a functional and well-designed GUI as apart of an object-oriented programming course.
